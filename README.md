# Contact List App

A basic Flutter app to manage contacts using SQLite for persistent storage.

## Features

- Add contacts with name and phone number.
- View all saved contacts in a list.
- Delete contacts.

## SQLite Usage

- SQLite is used to store contacts locally on the device.
- The app uses the `sqflite` package to interact with the SQLite database.
- Data is stored persistently, so contacts will remain even after the app is closed and reopened.
